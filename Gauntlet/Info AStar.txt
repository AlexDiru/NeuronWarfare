This folder contains functions and classes for an A* pathfinding algorithm

The pathfinding is used in the game, to calculate (in most cases) the quickest path.

The code is a modified version from the source code provided for the A* algorithm tutorial:

Classes:

Vector3 - s/e
SearchCell - represents one cell of the map grid
PathFinding - contains all the algorithms to create a path
			  i.e. [map, start, goal] ==> [PathFinding] ==> [path]
